Multiple Disease Prediction System 🏥🤖
Welcome to the Multiple Disease Prediction System, an intelligent web application built with Streamlit that predicts the risk of Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson’s Disease based on user health inputs. This AI-powered tool leverages pre-trained machine learning models to provide fast, accurate, and easy-to-understand diagnostic results. 💡

Features ✨
Diabetes Prediction: Analyze key factors like pregnancies, glucose, blood pressure, insulin levels, BMI, and age to estimate diabetes risk.

Heart Disease Prediction: Evaluate heart risk through chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, maximum heart rate, and more.

Parkinson’s Prediction: Detect Parkinson’s disease early using various voice signal features like jitter, shimmer, and more.

Intuitive Interface: A clean and responsive UI built with Streamlit, featuring dynamic input fields and an easy sidebar menu to switch between prediction modules seamlessly.

Fast and Reliable: Models are saved and loaded using Python’s pickle for quick predictions without retraining.

How It Works ⚙️
The application uses machine learning classification models trained on authentic medical datasets. For each disease, users input specific clinical and biometric data, which the model processes to predict disease presence or absence. The modular design allows smooth navigation and clear presentation of results.
